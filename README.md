Summary of this Project-
Airbnb functions as an online marketplace connecting individuals seeking to rent out their homes with those in search of accommodations in a given area. The platform spans over 100,000 cities across 220 countries globally. For hosts, it presents an opportunity to earn income while safeguarding their properties. However, for guests, it entails certain risks.

In this project, an analysis of Airbnb's 2019 data for New York City (NYC) is undertaken, a renowned global destination attracting millions of visitors with its cultural attractions, entertainment, dining, and business opportunities. The Office of New York State Comptroller reported that NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

The analysis focuses on key metrics influencing property listings on the Airbnb platform. Utilizing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, the aim is to uncover insights from the dataset, exploring the distribution of listings based on location, price range, room type, listing names, and other pertinent factors. The findings offer valuable insights for the marketing, finance, and technical teams at Airbnb, aiding in strategic, data-driven decision-making.
